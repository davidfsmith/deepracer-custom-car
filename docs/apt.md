# APT Repository

The APT repository is hosted at `https://aws-deepracer-community-sw.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/deepracer-custom-car` and is signed by a key with ID `CFB167A8F18DE6A634A6A2E4A63BC335D48DF8C6`.

There are two codenames `stable` and `experimental`, the former having more stable packages, and experimental hosting any new features in development, which may or may not work at all times.

The component matrix / architecture support is as follows:

| Hardware | Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) + ROS2 Foxy | Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) + ROS2 Humble |
|----------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------| 
| Original (`amd64`) | `dr-focal`                    | No                                 |
| Raspberry Pi (`arm64`) | No                 | `rpi4-jammy`                                | 
| Other x86 (`amd64`) | No                    | Source only                  |
